    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      The developer Juleast built the 'Simple Weather' application as
      a free application. The application is intended to be used as is.
      This site is to inform users of the polices I have and show transparency in terms of any
      collection, use or disclosure of personal data.
    </p>
    <h3>Personal Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      The application, 'Simple Weather' requires location access to
      function. During first run, the application attempts to autodetect
      your location to provide weather data. If this fails, the application
      will fall back to geolocating your current IP address. The developer Juleast 
      will never use the GPS data or IP address of your device to expose your 
      information to any service or individual. The GPS data and IP address is only used for the 
      application's core to function. The application also writes user preferences 
      to a json file to save it. Although the file only contains location
      and measurement information, make sure to never enter personal
      information such as credit card numbers, passwords, emails, etc.
      into the textfields in the application. If skeptical of the security of the
      application, the app is open source so you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/juleast/weatherAppMD">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
      Weather data is acquired from a third-party provider. This third-party
      provider will not have access to your data and the application only
      uses this provider in order to process weather data of your
      location. You can check out the provider's website 
      <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      The developer Juleast has considered the security of users
      extensively while building 'Simple Weather'. Although the 
      application in no way should allow access to your personal data
      to others, no internet device is completely safe so be advised
      and always secure your data and other important information.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy of Children</h3>
    <p>
      'Simple Weather' is an all-age use application and is safe for 
      children to use. Be advised all policies mentioned above this one
      applies to all users including children.
    </p>
    <h3>Modifications of These Policies</h3>
    <p>
      Please note that the application, 'Simple Weather' is still a
      growing application so more features may be added. Due to this, 
    current policies are subject to change thus, periodically check this
    page so that you are up to date.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2022-09-18</p>
